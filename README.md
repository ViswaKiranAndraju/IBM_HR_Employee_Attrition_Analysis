# IBM_HR_Employee_Attrition_Analysis
Attrition (when employees leave) is a big problem for companies. It costs a lot of time and money to train new people, and the company suffers when experienced employees go away. This also makes current employees worry and lose trust in the company.
## Project Highlights
- Developed a predictive logistic model with an accuracy of 88.44% to forecast employee attrition using the IBM HR-Employee-Attrition dataset.
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes attrition trends, factors, and actionable insights.
- Enhanced data-driven decision-making for stakeholders by transforming complex data into accessible visualizations.

## Logistic Model
The logistic model was built using Python and machine learning libraries. It predicts employee attrition based on relevant features and provides insights into the factors influencing attrition within the organization.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard offers an intuitive interface for exploring workforce insights. It includes visualizations for:
- Workforce demographics
- Attrition rates and trends
- Departmental performance
